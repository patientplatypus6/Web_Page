##### About<br/><br/>This story is an experimental interactive novel. The purpose is to create a universe based on a set of notes on characters, situations, and places from which multiple stories can be told.<br/><br/>##### How it works<br/><br/>The main story is written in an infinitely expandable chart with links to relevant linked sections in the graph view. The story will be a choose your own adventure style with arrows in the chart section allowing the reader to choose which direction the story should unfold.<br/><br/>##### The Graph Clusters<br/><br/>There are a few different distinct connect graphs which don't connect to each other. The largest will be various regions of the universe with connections by way of how people can travel between solar systems - this will be the GEOGRAPHIC graph. There is also  a CHARACTER graph which will have linkages between characters and their relationships - not a family tree, although familial relationships will be linked. The GEOGRAPHIC and CHARACTER GRAPH don't connect. There will also be a couple of other distinct graphs as the writing progresses.<br/><br/><br/>
