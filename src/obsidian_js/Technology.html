### Terran Technologies<br/>### Progenitor Technologies<br/>The progenitors are responsible for several technologies discovered by human beings, often from ruined or derelict settlements. The most important technologies are jump gates, but several other technologies exist. These can be classified broadly into four types - <br/>- <a href='/obsidian/Xenoarcheology.html'/>Xenoarcheology</a> - the study of the ruins of architectural settlements, including areas that have similar properties to jump gates.<br/>- <a href='/obsidian/Xenomechanics.html'/>Xenomechanics</a> - the study of the spaceships and other mechanical and physical sciences that humanity discovers upon first contact with the Progenitor races.<br/>- <a href='/obsidian/Xenolinguistics.html'/>Xenolinguistics</a> - the study of the languages of the Progenitor races, and the affect that the languages have on the Ataraxia and culture of the various species.<br/>- <a href='/obsidian/Xenobiology.html'/>Xenobiology</a> - the study of the biology of the alien species, with emphasis put upon the subfields of reproduction and brain development.
