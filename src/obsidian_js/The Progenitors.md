The Progenitors are a set of alien races that made the gates, in addition to a number of other architectural oddities that are found on several planets in the third epoch. They are sufficiently strange that communication is difficult, if not impossible, and it's not entirely clear which of the Pregenitors is responsible for which of the gates.
